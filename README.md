# ift6266h16
Course work for the ift6266h16 class

- prog1.py is the first assignment (MNIST)
- bricks and projects are quick extracts from my code using a second frequency RNN. This is quite new code and I havenâ€™t got it fully working on the dataset yet.

I've redirected the code for the project to https://github.com/TiSU32/play
